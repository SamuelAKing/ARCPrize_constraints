**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
There is one unique transformation function that maps x to y. Your job is to find that transformation function.
Given one input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors (as words) separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags
Please enclose the code with triple backticks (```python and then ``` at the end)

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors (as words) separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. The output is of the same dimensions as the input. 
2. All grey pixels in the input are grey in the output 
3.Each black shape of connectivity 4 in the output is translationally equal to a black shape in the input, occupying exactly the same rows, and it has at least one pixel directly to the left of a grey pixel.
4. The input and output have the same number of black shapes of connectivity 4.
5. In the output, each pixel is red if and only if it is to the left of a grey pixel and it is in the same row as a pixel that has a grey pixel two spaces to the right and that is in a pink shape of connectivity 4 that is orthogonally adjacent to a black shape of connectivity 4 and whose pixels are all orthogonally adjacent to four pixels that are either black or pink.
6. In the output, each pixel is pink, unless it is grey in the input, it is red, or it is black.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors represented by the integers 0-9 separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. The output is of the same dimensions as the input. 
2. All grey pixels in the input are grey in the output 
3.Each black shape of connectivity 4 in the output is translationally equal to a black shape in the input, occupying exactly the same rows, and it has at least one pixel directly to the left of a grey pixel.
4. The input and output have the same number of black shapes of connectivity 4.
5. In the output, each pixel is red if and only if it is to the left of a grey pixel and it is in the same row as a pixel that has a grey pixel two spaces to the right and that is in a pink shape of connectivity 4 that is orthogonally adjacent to a black shape of connectivity 4 and whose pixels are all orthogonally adjacent to four pixels that are either black or pink.
6. In the output, each pixel is pink, unless it is grey in the input, it is red, or it is black.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. The output is of the same dimensions as the input. 
2. All grey pixels in the input are grey in the output 
3.Each black shape of connectivity 4 in the output is translationally equal to a black shape in the input, occupying exactly the same rows, and it has at least one pixel directly to the left of a grey pixel.
4. The input and output have the same number of black shapes of connectivity 4.
5. In the output, each pixel is red if and only if it is to the left of a grey pixel and it is in the same row as a pixel that has a grey pixel two spaces to the right and that is in a pink shape of connectivity 4 that is orthogonally adjacent to a black shape of connectivity 4 and whose pixels are all orthogonally adjacent to four pixels that are either black or pink.
6. In the output, each pixel is pink, unless it is grey in the input, it is red, or it is black.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraint is not satisfied, you will be have failed. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a fucnction.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
There is one unique transformation function that maps x to y. Your job is to find that transformation function.
Given one input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors (as words) separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows.

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
There is one unique transformation function that maps x to y. Your job is to find that transformation function.
Given one input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors represented by the integers 0-9 separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags
Please enclose the code with triple backticks (```python and then ``` at the end)

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors (as words) separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. An irregularity is a pixel that is part of a one-colored shape of connectivity 8 containing less than 4 pixels or a pixel that doesn’t have at least 2 orthogonal neighbors that are the same color as itself, or 1 if it is adjacent to the border.
2. The output is of the same dimensions as the input.
3. A pixel is orange in the output if and only if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a black irregularity in the input and it is not a black irregularity in the input.
4. Unless it is orange in the output, each pixel that is a blue irregularity in the input is black in the output.
5. Unless it is orange or it is a blue irregularity in the input, each pixel in the output is of the same color as in the input.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as rows of colors represented by the integers 0-9 separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

prompt:
**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. An irregularity is a pixel that is part of a one-colored shape of connectivity 8 containing less than 4 pixels or a pixel that doesn’t have at least 2 orthogonal neighbors that are the same color as itself, or 1 if it is adjacent to the border.
2. The output is of the same dimensions as the input.
3. A pixel is orange in the output if and only if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to a black irregularity in the input and it is not a black irregularity in the input.
4. Unless it is orange in the output, each pixel that is a blue irregularity in the input is black in the output.
5. Unless it is orange or it is a blue irregularity in the input, each pixel in the output is of the same color as in the input.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect. They are coded in python, and they each appends to a list called "constraints" whether or not they have been satisfied. This python accepts "input" and "output", each being a 2d array of integers representing the input and the output.:

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraint is not satisfied, you will be have failed. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a fucnction.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
There is one unique transformation function that maps x to y. Your job is to find that transformation function.
Given one input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:{'train': [{'input': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 4, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 4, 4, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [7, 2, 2, 2, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 6, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7, 6, 7, 3, 3, 7, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7, 7, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7, 7, 7]], 'output': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2, 2, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 3, 7, 7], [7, 3, 3, 7, 7], [7, 3, 7, 7, 7], [7, 3, 7, 7, 7], [7, 3, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 4, 7, 7, 7], [7, 4, 4, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 4, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7], [7, 1, 1, 1, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]}, {'input': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 8, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 8, 7], [8, 8, 8, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [2, 2, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 2, 7], [7, 7, 7, 2, 2], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 9, 7, 9, 9], [7, 9, 9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]], 'output': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 9, 7, 9, 9, 6, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7], [7, 9, 9, 9, 7, 6, 7, 7, 2, 2, 7, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 7], [7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 6, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]}, {'input': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7], [7, 8, 8, 8, 7, 6, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]], 'output': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 8, 8, 8, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7], [7, 7, 8, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [7, 7, 1, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 9, 7, 7], [7, 9, 9, 9, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]}], 'test': [{'input': [[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7], [4, 4, 7, 4, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 4, 4], [7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 7, 4, 4, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 6, 7, 4, 7, 4, 4], [7, 4, 7, 4, 7, 6, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7], [7, 4, 7, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]], 'output': ''}, {'input': [[7, 7, 7, 9, 7], [7, 7, 9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 9, 7, 7], [7, 9, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 2, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 7, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7, 7], [7, 7, 2, 7, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 2, 7, 7], [7, 2, 2, 2, 7], [7, 7, 7, 2, 7], [7, 7, 7, 2, 7], [7, 7, 7, 2, 7], [6, 6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7, 9, 7], [7, 7, 9, 9, 7], [7, 9, 9, 7, 7], [7, 9, 7, 7, 7]], 'output': ''}]}
Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags
Please enclose the code with triple backticks (```python and then ``` at the end)

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. Each shape of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors in the input is translationally equal to a shape of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors in the output.
2. The number of shapes of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors is the same in the input and the output.
3. In the output, each pink pixel in the output is orthogonally adjacent to exactly two non-pink pixels: either they are both of the color of the background or neither of them is.
4. In the output, in each pink shape of connectivity 4, there is exactly one pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to exactly two non-pink pixels that both aren’t of the color of the background.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. Each shape of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors in the input is translationally equal to a shape of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors in the output.
2. The number of shapes of connectivity 4 and of non-pink colors is the same in the input and the output.
3. In the output, each pink pixel in the output is orthogonally adjacent to exactly two non-pink pixels: either they are both of the color of the background or neither of them is.
4. In the output, in each pink shape of connectivity 4, there is exactly one pixel that is orthogonally adjacent to exactly two non-pink pixels that both aren’t of the color of the background.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraint is not satisfied, you will be have failed. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a fucnction.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags.

Write the transformation function in sufficient detail to allow for direct code verification. The program should take in a x grid for a given training examples and output the corresponding y grid. Any concept/rule/pattern described cannot have any ambiguity and must be described very specifically. 
Then output one single python function "transform(input)" enclosed by ```python and ```. Expect to take a single numpy array as input x and should return a single numpy array as output y (not necessarily of same size). Write as many helper functions as needed. Import any standard python library (e.g., numpy, pandas, scipy, collections, itertools, pillow, networkx).

The transformation likely involves abstract concepts and relationships: e.g., “symmetry”," “rotation”, “connected components”, "scaling (up or down)", "vertical/horizontal translation", "copying", "connecting points", "partitions of grid", "Containing / being contained / being inside or outside of a perimeter", "counting" , "sorting objects (e.g. sorting by size)", "comparing (e.g. which shape or symbol appears the most? Which is the largest object? Which objects are the same size?)"

Avoid long if/else chains. Rules that use long if/else chains are likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules which refer to specific indices of rows and columns as those are more likely to be spurious. Also avoid rules that identify a certain pair and act accordingly as those are always spurious.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags
Please enclose the code with triple backticks (```python and then ``` at the end)

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. The dimensions of the output are (1, number of non-background pixels in the input).
2. A pixel in the input and a pixel in the output that are both in the shape of non-background colours and of connectivity 4 and that have the same distance this shape from the highest non-background pixel that only has one non-background neighbor are of the same color.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will have failed.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.

**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1. The dimensions of the output are (1, number of non-background pixels in the input).
2. A pixel in the input and a pixel in the output that are both in the shape of non-background colours and of connectivity 4 and that have the same distance this shape from the highest non-background pixel that only has one non-background neighbor are of the same color.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraint is not satisfied, you will be have failed. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a fucnction.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.
