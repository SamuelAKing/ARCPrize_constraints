**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.
Colours in the grid are equivalent to integers according to this color mapping:
COLOUR_mapping = {{0: 'black',
                  1: 'blue',
                  2: 'red',
                  3: 'green',
                  4: 'yellow',
                  5: 'gray',
                  6: 'pink',
                  7: 'orange',
                  8: 'teal',
                  9: 'brown'}}

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect:
1.All shapes are considered to consist of only one colour (not black) and to be of connectivity 4.
2.The divider is the shape that contains a full column or a full row. If it contains a full row, it is horizontal, and if it contains a full column, it is vertical.
3.The output is of the same dimensions as the input.
4.The input and output dividers are equal.
5.Each shape in the input is translationally equal to a shape in the output.
6.There is the same number of shapes in the input and in the output.
7.In the output, if the divider is vertical, in each row, there are no black pixels between two non-black pixels.
8.In the output, if the divider is horizontal, in each column, there are no black pixels between two non-black pixels.

Here is a list of definitions that may have been used in the constraints. They can be usefull to understand the constraints and to structure your reasoning:
Shape: a shape is a set of pixels (of the same color or whose colors are drawn from a specified set of colors) in which each pixel has a path of adjacent pixels to every other pixel.
Here, adjacency can either be defined by orthogonal adjacency, or orthogonal and diagonal adjacency. 
These will be written as a shape of connectivity 4 in the first case and a shape of connectivity 8 in the second case.
Two shapes are equal if all their pixels are equal.
Two shapes are translationally equal if one can be obtained by changing the position of each of its pixels by the same amount
Two shapes are rotationally equal if one is translationally equal to the rotation of the other’s grid by either 0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°.
Distance: the distance between two pixels in a shape is the minimum number of steps between adjacent pixels in the shape needed to go from one pixel to the other.
Background: the background is the set of all pixels of the most common color.

These constraints and definitions have been generated by God. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed, and you will be permanently terminated.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is small, do not edit the previous candidate solution, start over from scratch instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission, simply start over, indicating the tag RESET.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will be permanently terminated.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a function.
Do not write a function generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.
