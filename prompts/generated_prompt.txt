**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.

The grids are represented as rows of colors represented by the integers 0-9 separated by new lines. Newlines separate rows. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:

Here is a list of constraints that accurately and completely describe the task. If they are all satisfied, the proposed solution is correct, and if one or more of them, isn't satisfied, the proposed solution is incorrect. They are coded in python, and they each appends to a list called "constraints" whether or not they have been satisfied. This python accepts "input" and "output", each being a 2d array of integers representing the input and the output.:

These constraints and definitions have been generated by God. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed, and you will be permanently terminated.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is small, do not edit the previous candidate solution, start over from scratch instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically. When you do this, do not ask for permission, simply start over, indicating the tag RESET.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraints is not satisfied, you will be permanently terminated.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
