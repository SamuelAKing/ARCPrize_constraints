**Objective:** Solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC) task.

**Input Format:** Given 2-7 training example consider of an input grid (x_train) and an output grid (y_train). Each grid is rectangular and be of size up to 30x30. The grid size of x_train may be different than y_train. 
Given an input grid x_test you must must output the correct corresponding y_test grid.

The grids are represented as a JSON object containing 2D arrays of colors represented by the integers 0-9. You cannot perform arithmetic on these integers.
Here are the input and output grids for the task:{'train': [{'input': [[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]], 'output': [[1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [3], [3], [3], [3], [2], [2], [2], [2], [2], [4], [4], [4], [4], [4], [6], [6], [6]]}, {'input': [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]], 'output': [[8], [8], [8], [8], [8], [8], [8], [2], [2], [2], [2], [2], [2], [2], [2], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3], [3]]}], 'test': [{'input': [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]], 'output': ''}]}

These constraints and definitions have been generated and tested by a trustworthy source. They are true in the train and test pairs. They MUST all be respected in the output you provide. If even one constraint has not been followed, the solution you have provided will be incorrect, you will have failed.

For any reasoning before finding the pattern, please enclose thinking in <reasoning></reasoning> tags. 
Please enclose the pattern description in <description></description> tags

When your reasonings and descriptions are done, verify that each fact about the Pairs is true, and that no mistakes have been made. If you realize that you were wrong, correct yourself, and verify which parts of the reasoning were incorrect, and which further reasonings you need to correct.
When you generate a solution, verify that each constraint is satisfied. If one constraint has not been satisfied, provide another candidate solution and start over untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained. Do not stop untill a solution satisfying all constraints has been obtained.
Noticing mistakes is good, as it means you are on the path towards a better solution. Mistakes are a part of the process, but they must be corrected.
When you notice a mistake, unless it is major, do not start over from scratch, edit the previous candidate solution instead.
If you find the problem is getting complex, don't stop, proceed with a completely fresh analysis, examining the input grid more systematically.
Remember to verify constraint by constraint any proposed solution before claiming it is final. If any constraint is not satisfied, you will be have failed. When you do this, do not ask for permission.
Your task is to output a grid that fits each of the constraints specified above.
Do not produce code. If you do produce code, create instead the grid that the code would produce as an output. Do not print or return this grid as python code, instead write it out. If you do write code, do not rewrite the input grid. Instead, accept it as an input to a fucnction.
Do not write an output generator or any associated functions, instead write out what their output would be.
